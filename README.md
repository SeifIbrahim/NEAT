# NEAT
A Neural Net written to play Ben Karcher's platformer game. I wrote the AI player using Neural Networks which I trained
through a neuro-evolutionary algorithm known as NEAT. The algorithm works by generating, mutating, cross-breeding and selecting
neural networks based on their “fitness” in solving the level — very similar to evolution in nature. The player was able to learn by itself how to complete a level without dying with the only inputs being the map of the level, the destination it should try to get to, and the controls to the game. The player can learn an average level in just a few hours and ends up outperforming human players on timed levels.
